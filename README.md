# AndroidThings
Description
This little app is designed to demonstrate your understanding of the different parts of App development that
are required on a daily basis. It will give The Project Factory an opportunity to understand your coding style
and project structure.
The App only has two screens; one Screen to Add/Remove “decisions” values that can persist, and another
screen that reacts to a random selection process and chooses a decision from the list created previously. This
little demo should only take a short amount of time, but feel free to do more or less depending on what you
are comfortable with and your skill level.
Try to show off your skills as a developer, feel free to add some colour and animation to it, and most
importantly have fun! We can’t wait to see what you make of it!
